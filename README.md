**Objective of this project:**
The objective of this project is to automate the process of finding defects in the casting process. A casting defect is an undesired irregularity in a metal casting process. For removing this defective product all industries have their quality inspection department. But the main problem is that this inspection process is carried out manually. It is a very time-consuming process and due to human error, the process of rejecting defects is not 100% accurate. This can be the cause of rejection of an entire order which would lead to huge losses. Our model will try to eliminate this loss of revenue and make the QC process as accurate as possible.


**Conclusions:**
This project helped me understand how useful deep learning and image classification can be in real industries. Inspection and quality control is an aspect I have observed in all my past internships. Whether it be with robotic systems or welding processes. An advantage of ML and DL models is that it can be implemented on other image sets with minimal changes. This makes it much more advantageous and is now the new way of programming.
For future work, this project could be a game changer for quality control in heavy machinery industries. However, adopting this in the industry could take some time due to infrastructure requirements like cameras and a set process which would automate the Quality Control process.
